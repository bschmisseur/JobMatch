# Job Match PHP Laravel
My partner and I were tasked to create a Laravel based application in which a user can search through job listings and maintian a profile in order to apply for jobs. This application was based off LinkedIn utilizing features given by laravel such as security, middleware, and blade. Also this application provides a REST API for the users and job listings that are in the database for the application.
